 Uses react and redux

# setup
```
git clone
npm install
npm test
npm run build
```

# Redux?
Redux is absolute overkill and decidedly unnecessary here. The point was to practice with the tools I was learning, even if it means a spike in complexity for no tangible benefit (bad design).

# deepFreeze, createAction
I either didn't have these libraries available and/or thought it would be good practice to implement their described functionality (or a usable portion of it) myself. It's the minor upside to a CDN being down :)
