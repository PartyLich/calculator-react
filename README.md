 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/PartyLich/pen/xxKNaNx](https://codepen.io/PartyLich/pen/xxKNaNx).

 Uses react and redux

# setup
```
$ git clone <this repo>
$ npm install
$ npm test
$ npm run build
```

# Redux?
Redux is absolute overkill and decidedly unnecessary here. The point was to practice with the tools I was learning, even if it means a spike in complexity for no tangible benefit (bad design).

# deepFreeze, createAction
I either didn't have these libraries available and/or thought it would be good practice to implement their described functionality (or a usable portion of it) myself. It's the minor upside to a CDN being down :)
